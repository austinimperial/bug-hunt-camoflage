export const howToUseIt = `TL;DR: This is an evolution simulation. It is designed to demonstrate how a population evolves when subjected to a selection pressure. Here’s how it works: You, the user, act as a predator searching out and consuming prey, the bugs on the screen. Your visual abilities provide the selection pressure for bug evolution. To eat a bug, simply hover your cursor over it (or tap on touch screens). Bugs that stick out against the background image will quickly be weeded out; Bugs that are harder to find will tend to survive longer and reproduce more often. When a bug gets eaten, a randomly chosen surviving bug produces an offspring. One out, one in. The offspring undergo a mutation, so their color is slightly different than that of their parent. Eventually (usually after a couple of minutes of munching) the hard-to-find bugs will have outcompeted the stand-out bugs. The population will have evolved the strategy of camouflage as a means of survival.  You can see the progress of the simulation recorded in the Population Snapshots graphic located below the simulation screen.`

export const relating = `Why is this simulation a useful one? It’s useful because it tells us something about how the world works. Specifically, the main purpose of this simulation is to show that variation is the fuel of natural selection (Dawkins?); Populations cannot evolve if their constituents do not differ from one another. This fundamental principle of evolution is the simulation’s primary takeaway. By itself, it’s not too difficult a thing to understand. But there’s a real risk of it being only partially understood if taken out of context. What I want to point out is that the point the simulation makes is a general one. It applies to natural selection wherever it occurs, whether in the wildernesses of the world, on a different planet, or in a computer simulation. This is because natural selection is an algorithmic process. Its operation does not depend on a specific medium (For a complete account of this idea, read ’Darwin’s Dangerous Idea’ by Daniel Dennett). So, when relating this simulation to the real world, it's not just about colorful insects, or animals in the woods, or even living organisms. It’s about natural selection as an abstract process. In short, this simulation is an exercise in generalizing the principles of evolution. 7-29-20: To be continued...`

export const history = `This simulation, like its own bugs, has evolved over time. The present version is the fourth generation. Beth Bishop and Charles Anderson describe the first version in June, 1986 in EVOLUTION BY NATURAL SELECTION: A TEACHING MODULE (link: https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED272383.pdf) They describe an instructional game involving bead bugs (actual beads) on a blanket. The game was made into a computer simulation in the mid 90’s by Steve Brewer of U-Mass, with the most recent version released on 6/10/1995. In 2005, Uri Wilensky and M. Novak implemented the game in Wilensky’s NetLogo platform, a powerful population simulation framework. In the present version, Bishop and Anderson’s core concept survives. I based this version primarily on Wilensky and Novak’s model. These are the features that I added: 
1) population snapshots - graphical representation of the bug tree of decent
2) dominant colors in image/ dominant colors in population
3) random step capability
4) custom initial bugs - choose whatever color bugs you want in the simulation’s initial state, rather than a random set. 

I am pleased to offer this newest iteration of the bead bug hunt, and I look forward to someone making an even better version.`
